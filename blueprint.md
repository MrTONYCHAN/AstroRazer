# Astro + Firebase Hosting Project

## Overview

This project is a basic Astro application deployed to Firebase Hosting.

## Project Setup & Deployment

### Firebase Initialization

1.  **Created Firebase Project:** A new Firebase project with the ID `astrorazor-34588940` was created.
2.  **Set Active Project:** The Firebase CLI was configured to use `astrorazor-34588940` as the active project for this directory.
3.  **Configured Firebase Hosting:**
    *   A `.firebaserc` file was created to link the directory to the `astrorazor-34588940` project.
    *   A `firebase.json` file was created to configure Firebase Hosting.
        *   The `public` directory was set to `dist`, which is the standard build output directory for Astro projects.
        *   Files like `firebase.json`, `.git` artifacts, and `node_modules` are ignored during deployment.

### Build & Deployment

1.  **Installed Dependencies:** `npm install` was run to install the necessary Node.js packages.
2.  **Built Project:** `npm run build` was executed to build the Astro application. This generated the static files in the `dist/` directory.
3.  **Deployed to Firebase Hosting:** `firebase deploy` was used to upload the contents of the `dist/` directory to Firebase Hosting.

## Current Task: Firebase Project Initialization and Deployment

The following steps were completed to set up and deploy the project to Firebase Hosting:

1.  Created a new Firebase project: `astrorazor-34588940`.
2.  Set `astrorazor-34588940` as the active project.
3.  Created `.firebaserc` to link the project.
4.  Created `firebase.json` to configure hosting from the `dist` directory.
5.  Ran `npm install` to install dependencies.
6.  Ran `npm run build` to build the Astro project.
